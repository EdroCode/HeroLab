### Project Description - [ITCH](https://edroz.itch.io/herolab)

This project is a versatile character inventory manager and creator, built for my good friend [ABACAXI](https://www.tiktok.com/@abacaxigrelhado?lang=en), who also designed the in-game UI elements. It allows users to easily manage items, customize characters (including names, levels, and attributes), and engage in battles against enemies.
